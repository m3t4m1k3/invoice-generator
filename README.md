## Learning Goals

Implement a basic vanilla JavaScript application based on a list of specifications and a Figma design file.

## Core Requirements

- [x] Array to hold services requested
- [x] Buttons to add service to array
- [x] Place to display data from array - updated every time the array changes
- [x] Don't charge more than once for the same service
- [x] Total cost stays updated
- [x] Button to "send invoice" (reset)

## Stretch Requirements

- [x] Remove items after adding

## Additional Personal Stretch Requirements

- [ ] None at this time

These are requirements I added to challenge myself further. These come from noticing improvements that could be made while completing the core and stretch project requirements.

## Design

The design will be as per the the image below specified by the designer. See the complete [Figma project here](https://www.figma.com/file/roUn8DT7zHTI9tcL2JXNZG/Invoice-Generator?node-id=0%3A1).
